# Flow backend

This repo is for demonstration purposes.

It contains all backend code of a personal project I'm working on in private.

## Stack

Modularized Ruby on Rails application with MySQL db. Try to follow DDD principles with the use of interactors and services as "use cases" to apply to my domain logic.

Mainly unit tests with some integration tests at the controller level. There's not 100% coverage and do not aspire to it yet; goal is to code fast and iterate quickly.
